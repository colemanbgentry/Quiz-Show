# Overview

Another language I was unfamiliar with, challenge accepted. I wanted to continue to learn more and more languages,
to have been able to say that I have been there and tried that. With Kotlin, I did have moments that I was like what and huh
but in the end I think I made something awesome.

Kotlin has a few similarities with Java, while being built with its libraries. It is also said that people are flooding to this language for its better than Java. 
My opinion would be its alright, I wish it was easier to get it set up, but in the end it worked out. 

I wanted another game, that all I have been making so far, and I wanted to keep the theme going. So I hope that you like it. 

Here is a link to my YouTube channel that has a video of the program.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
Kotlin was the main programming language that I used, with the Intellj Idea community text editor. 

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
No libraries were used in the journey but in the end I made something awesome. 

# Useful Websites

A few of the places I went to gain knowledge of the language. 
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming)
* [Kotlin.Org](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/F9UC9DY-vIU)

# Future Work

* I plan on making this come out of Kotlin and making it somewhere else or actually making it to a full on game. 
* I would have liked to work on it elsewhere, but trying new editors would be fun. Learn more of this editor and more libraries would definitely be for my favor.
